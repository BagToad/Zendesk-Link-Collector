# Privacy Policy

# Information We Collect
No information is transmitted off of your devices or sent back to any server.

This extension reads data on `https://*.zendesk.com/*` sites you are visiting, sends requests to those sites on behalf of you, and stores the results of those requests in storage and memory for the purpose of displaying that information in the extension UI in a formatted way. 

Your settings, such as link RegEx and titles are collected from your input and stored in your browser storage.

# How We Use Your Information
The Zendesk URL and page data (ticket comments and metadata) are collected and stored only in memory and in local storage for the purpose of displaying the processed information in the extension UI.

Each time a new Zendesk ticket is processed, the previous ticket data is cleared from storage. 

On applicable browsers, settings are synced between devices according to your browser's capability. If you have browser sync disabled in your browser, this extensions settings are stored locally instead. Ticket data is never synced between devices. 

Absolutely no data is transmitted off of your devices or sent back to any server.

# Security of Your Information
Your data does not leave your browsers beyond that which is defined in the [Google Chrome sync](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#property-sync) and [Firefox sync](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync) APIs.

Every effort is made to ensure that your data is handled responsibly and in accordance with standard industry practices for browser extensions.
