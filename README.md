## Features

### Links
- Links are aggregated according to custom RegEx patterns.
- No other chaos from the ticket is included in the link, only actual links are considered (`a` elements).
    - Links can optionally display "context". This shows the surrounding text beside the link (the context is the parent element of the `a` element).  
- Scroll to a link's source comment by clicking the spyglass icon beside a link.
