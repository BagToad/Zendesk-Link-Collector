# Zendesk Link Collector 

This is a browser extension that collects links from a Zendesk ticket according to custom Regular Expression (regex) values. This tool's purpose is to help Zendesk users more easily handle _long_ tickets where links and/or attachments are key information.

## Features

### Link Aggregation
- Links are aggregated according to custom regex patterns.
- No other chaos from the ticket is included in the link, only actual links are considered (`a` anchor elements).
    - Links can optionally display "context" when the "Show context?" checkbox option selected. This shows the surrounding text beside the link (the context is the parent HTML element of the `a` element).  
- Scroll to a link's source comment by clicking the spyglass icon (üîç) beside a link.

- Attachments are aggregated.
- Scroll to an attachment's source comment by clicking the spyglass icon beside a link.

## Project Strucutre

The project is structured like a typical manifest v3 browser extension, with some slight differences. For example, we have separate browser-specific manifest files and a `makefile` to build for each target browser.

Below is a diagram of the project using [`githubocto/repo-visualizer`](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer/).
