# Zendesk Link Collector

## Features

### Links
- Links are aggregated according to custom regex patterns.
- No other chaos from the ticket is included in the link, only actual links are considered (`a` anchor elements).
    - Links can optionally display "context" when the "Show context?" checkbox option selected. This shows the surrounding text beside the link (the context is the parent HTML element of the `a` element).  
- Scroll to a link's source comment by clicking the spyglass icon (üîç) beside a link.
